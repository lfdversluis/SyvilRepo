\section{Conclusion}
	
	In this paper we provided an overview of scientific articles and investigated their datasets used.
	From this, we conclude that even though most articles use real-world data, most papers do not or not accurately mention the details of their dataset.
	Moreover, we conclude that no article actively promotes/offers its dataset for further research.
	
	We therefore gathered the datasets used in these scientific papers and added some additional datasets by means of third parties and creating new datasets ourselves using manual annotation and other means.
	The result is an overview of datasets which have one unifying format, are publicly available and can be used for further research.
