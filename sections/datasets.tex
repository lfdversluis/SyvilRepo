\section{Datasets}
	As observed in Section \ref{sct:datasets_articles}, none of the datasets used has a ground truth.
	To allow further research to evaluate their work, a list of datasets is provided in Table .
	For each dataset, its key aspects such as size, creation date, origin 
	To ensure minimal effort required to use the datasets, we have parsed all obtained datasets into one unifying format.
	This format will be explained first.
	
	\subsection{Format}
		The format of each dataset is as follows:
		\emph{Very nice format here.}
