\section{Datasets in scientific articles}
	\label{sct:datasets_articles}
	
	We have composed a list of scientific articles on the topic of the sybil attack. 
	We list -- where applicable and available -- the year, amount of nodes in the dataset, amount of sybils, whether it concerns real or synthetic data and whether the dataset is publicly available and mentioned in the paper.
	The results of this can be found in Table \ref{tbl:state-of-the-art-reviewed}.
	
	We observe that none of the papers mention the availability of their dataset in their paper. 
	Also, all papers do not use a dataset with a ground truth.
