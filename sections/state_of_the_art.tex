\section{Datasets in scientific articles}
	\label{sct:datasets_articles}
	
	We have composed a list of scientific articles on the topic of the sybil attack. 
	We list -- where applicable and available -- the year, amount of nodes in the dataset, amount of sybils, whether it concerns real or synthetic data and whether the dataset is publicly available and mentioned in the paper.
	The results of this can be found in Table \ref{tbl:state-of-the-art-reviewed}.
	
	Our conclusion based upon this review is that even though most datasets use real data, often the sybils are fake or the ground-truth is missing.
	Some articles do not mention details of their dataset, such as amount of sybils, whether the ground-truth is known or the exact amount of nodes in their dataset.
	Moreover, we conclude that none of the articles mention the availability of their dataset nor actively promote it for further research.
