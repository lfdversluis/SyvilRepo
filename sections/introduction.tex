\section{Introduction}

	This survey will focus on real-world attacks using Sybil, eclipse and sinkholing techniques. 
	We perceive these to be belonging to the same broad class of attacks. 
	The goal is to provide a list of scientific articles which are based on a publicly available real-world datasets. 
	The outcome of this survey will be the largest structured collection of various datasets and the actual datasets themselves in the form of supplementary material.
	
	The list of datasets will, for instance, cover fake profiles on social networking sites (Facebook), communication systems (Twitter), search engine link farms, auction sites, review sites, sock puppets on news sites, and various other Internet-deployed systems. 
	A key challenge is the diversity and formatting of these datasets. 
	The goal is to design a unifying format to enable scientists to easily use all available datasets for their latest research findings with minimal effort.
	
	The survey will provide a structured listing with key aspects of each dataset, such as, description, origin, size, creation date, and copyright license.
